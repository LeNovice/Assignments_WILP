Assignment Questions
Q1)Write a code to perform Gauss elimination with and without pivotingfor a 2 x 2 system, taking the number of significant digits (d) to be considered as user input. Using the code, solve the 2 x 2 system with random coefficientsford= 3,4,5 and 6.  Display the results in a tabular form.

Q2)Write a code to perform
a)  Gauss Jacobi method
b)  Gauss Seidel method

for a 3 x 3 system by checking the convergence criteria using a suitable norm.Test the method on a random 3 x 3 system, which is diagonally dominantand check your results.  A comparison between the two methods should bepresented in tabular form.  The stopping criteria could be taken as the low-est iteration number when the relative percentage error is less than 1%.Generate a random matrix of size 3 x 3 which cannot be made diagonallydominant and check if the iterates converge.  The random entries generatedshould be of the form n.ddd
